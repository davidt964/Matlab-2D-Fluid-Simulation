# Matlab-2D-Fluid-Simulation
This project utilizes smoothed particle hydrodynamics and spatial hashing to simulate a grid of interacting fluid particles.
Various fluids can be simulated by changing parameters such as p_rho (fluid rest density), h (smoothing radius), and p_mu (viscosity coefficient).
There are several bugs currently with the program; namely, the forces and corresponding velocities are too large, causing all the particles to fly
out of the boundaries after a certain period of time.
