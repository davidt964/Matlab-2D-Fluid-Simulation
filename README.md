# Matlab-2D-Fluid-Simulation
This project utilizes smoothed particle hydrodynamics and spatial hashing to simulate a grid of interacting fluid particles.
Various fluids can be simulated by changing parameters such as p_rho (fluid rest density), h (smoothing radius), and p_mu (viscosity coefficient).
There are several bugs currently with the program; namely, the forces and corresponding velocities are too large, causing all the particles to fly
out of the boundaries after a certain period of time.

# Project Report
A report of the findings can be found on my LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidt964/). It breaks down the code and provides explanation to much of the logic behind it. Furthermore, it acknowledges shortcomings of the program while demonstrating the potential uses of the script.
